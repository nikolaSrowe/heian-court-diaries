## Topic: The Role of Literary Court Diaries in Shaping Heian Japan Court Culture and Politics


This project is a presentation of a sociopolitical analysis of Heian Japan court diaries written by women, presented with Scrollama.js as a story. The analysis includes the summarization of 3 specific diaries:
1. Murasaki Shikibu's Diary
2. Izumi Shikibu's Diary
3. The Sarashina Diary

After introducing the reader to the three narratives, we examine 4 main introspective sections: Heian women and the Kana script, Heian court diaries as political records, Heian diaires and cultural tools, the restriction of women reflected in literature. Much of the analysis of these court diaries reveal the gendered undertone of the societal norms and way of life during this period of Japan which results in a feministic understanding of womens lives. All three women discuss their own struggles navigating through poltical and social structures which we empathize with as we watch them grapple, dealing with not just ideals forced upon them but the subconsioucly internalized beliefs they reflect on one another.

The design of the site is meant to imitate a gallery, making a user "walk through" each part of understanding the analysis. We begin with a header, a title followed by its Japanese translation and time period. Each step has its own corresponding artwork meant to assist the user to witnessing courtlife. Below, the references are listed in alphabetic order. They are responsive and help link the reader to more sources.

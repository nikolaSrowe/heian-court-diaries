    <h1>Heian Court Diaries</h1>
    <p class="intro">Heian Court Diaries were written by aristocratic women and served as political records 
      of women‚Äôs lives in Heian culture. These diaries heavily reflected and influenced gender roles, 
      court traditions and rules, and literacy aesthetics.</p>
    <p class="intro">
      The big three of their time; Lady Murasaki Shikibu, Lady Izumi Shikibu, and Lady Sarashina, have 
      everlasting diaries which echo the customs of the upper class, the regulations between male and 
      female courtships, and show the empowerment that literacy gave women in court.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      As you scroll, you will see the evolution of women's dominance in writing starting with the 
      introduction of Chinese literacy and Buddhism until the fall of the Fujiwara clan, marking the end of 
      the Heian era. You will experience images and narratives that illustrate how these writings shaped 
      not only the personal identities of court women but also the broader sociopolitical aspect of Heian 
      Japan.

        <h2 class="step-heading">Heian Japan</h2>
        <p class="step-content">The Heian era of Japan started in 794 and lasted until 1186, marking a period 
          of cultural refinement of artistic potential. This period is more known to historians as the 
          mark of the rise and fall of the Fujiwara family, a powerful clan that gradually absorbed all civil
           offices in the Kingdom. The Japanese elite court cultivated the highest forms of art; poetry, 
           calligraphy, dress, and colour showcasing its rare and expensive culture. Within this enclosed 
           society, educated and artistic women held soft powers in court. They came to produce the literary 
           genre of diaries, whose artistic beauty exposed the masked reality of political discourse and 
           rivalries that affected the court with love affairs and alliances. </p>
        <p class="step-content">Chinese civilization was introduced to Japan around 310 A.D with Buddhism soon 
          followed in 552. Its influence are two big factors to understanding Japan and its history. The art of 
          writing came along with the introduction of Chinese civilization and because of the nature of the 
          Chinese writing system, it came to be considered a language of learning. Many important pieces of 
          writing were written in Chinese despite it not being Japan's native language, with scholars learning 
          it to deem themselves educated and intellectual. However, women were able to loop around the 
          male-domniated Chinese literary tradition with kana writing. With this, women gained linguistic 
          freedom allowing their works to be organically Japanese to their roots.</p>
        <p class="step-content">Women, before the feudal period, were still educated and even allowed a share of
           inheritance, with China calling Japan the ‚Äúqueen country‚Äù because of the status that women enjoyed 
           there (xiv). It's very important to note that much of the best literature Japan has produced has been
            written by women, as the Heian era prioritized lineage over merit,and as a repercussion were more 
            restricted here than they were in China. This concentrated education and scribal practices within 
            elite families which ensured a woman's access to literacy.</p>
        <p class="step-content">The court officials and authors of these diaries, who were daughters of governors,
           would have been related to the Fujiwara clan in varying degrees. Court life required little to no 
           work,  which left a great amount of time on their hands to write poetry which ultimately evolved into
            etiquette that took part in many court traditions. It became a part of every possible event and as a
             result became cultivated to a high degree (xv). People of all social classes took pilgrimages to 
             temples and shrines ‚Äúfor the good of their souls‚Äù. Xviii. Many of these religious ventures can be 
             found documented within these diaries which can give us some idea of the hold that Buddhism had over
              the educated mind of the Fujiwara family. 
        </p>
        <p class="step-content">We have come to know literacy as a powerful tool, and the women of the Heian 
          court exceeded the constraints of lineage-status, wielding the kana script in its full potential 
          to claim agency in society. Through the diaries of Lady Murasaki Shikibu, Izumi Shikibu, and Sarashina
           we will gain first hand insight on the observations and the enduring cultural influence of these 
           texts.</p>

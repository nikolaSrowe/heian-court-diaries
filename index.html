    <!-- <h1>Heian Court Diaries</h1> -->
    <p class="intro">Heian Court Diaries were written by aristocratic women and served as political records 
      of women’s lives in Heian culture. These diaries heavily reflected and influenced gender roles, 
      court traditions and rules, and literacy aesthetics.</p>
    <p class="intro">
      The big three of their time; Lady Murasaki Shikibu, Lady Izumi Shikibu, and Lady Sarashina, have 
      everlasting diaries which echo the customs of the upper class, the regulations between male and 
      female courtships, and show the empowerment that literacy gave women in court.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      As you scroll, you will see the evolution of women's dominance in writing starting with the 
      introduction of Chinese literacy and Buddhism until the fall of the Fujiwara clan, marking the end of 
      the Heian era. You will experience images and narratives that illustrate how these writings shaped 
      not only the personal identities of court women but also the broader sociopolitical aspect of Heian 
      Japan.

        <h2 class="step-heading">Heian Japan</h2>
        <p class="step-content">The Heian era of Japan started in 794 and lasted until 1186, marking a period 
          of cultural refinement of artistic potential. This period is more known to historians as the 
          mark of the rise and fall of the Fujiwara family, a powerful clan that gradually absorbed all civil
           offices in the Kingdom. The Japanese elite court cultivated the highest forms of art; poetry, 
           calligraphy, dress, and colour showcasing its rare and expensive culture. Within this enclosed 
           society, educated and artistic women held soft powers in court. They came to produce the literary 
           genre of diaries, whose artistic beauty exposed the masked reality of political discourse and 
           rivalries that affected the court with love affairs and alliances. </p>
        <p class="step-content">Chinese civilization was introduced to Japan around 310 A.D with Buddhism soon 
          followed in 552. Its influence are two big factors to understanding Japan and its history. The art of 
          writing came along with the introduction of Chinese civilization and because of the nature of the 
          Chinese writing system, it came to be considered a language of learning. Many important pieces of 
          writing were written in Chinese despite it not being Japan's native language, with scholars learning 
          it to deem themselves educated and intellectual. However, women were able to loop around the 
          male-domniated Chinese literary tradition with kana writing. With this, women gained linguistic 
          freedom allowing their works to be organically Japanese to their roots.</p>
        <p class="step-content">Women, before the feudal period, were still educated and even allowed a share of
           inheritance, with China calling Japan the “queen country” because of the status that women enjoyed 
           there (xiv). It's very important to note that much of the best literature Japan has produced has been
            written by women, as the Heian era prioritized lineage over merit,and as a repercussion were more 
            restricted here than they were in China. This concentrated education and scribal practices within 
            elite families which ensured a woman's access to literacy.</p>
        <p class="step-content">The court officials and authors of these diaries, who were daughters of governors,
           would have been related to the Fujiwara clan in varying degrees. Court life required little to no 
           work,  which left a great amount of time on their hands to write poetry which ultimately evolved into
            etiquette that took part in many court traditions. It became a part of every possible event and as a
             result became cultivated to a high degree (xv). People of all social classes took pilgrimages to 
             temples and shrines “for the good of their souls”. Xviii. Many of these religious ventures can be 
             found documented within these diaries which can give us some idea of the hold that Buddhism had over
              the educated mind of the Fujiwara family. 
        </p>
        <p class="step-content">We have come to know literacy as a powerful tool, and the women of the Heian 
          court exceeded the constraints of lineage-status, wielding the kana script in its full potential 
          to claim agency in society. Through the diaries of Lady Murasaki Shikibu, Izumi Shikibu, and Sarashina
           we will gain first hand insight on the observations and the enduring cultural influence of these 
           texts.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step" data-step="2">
        <h2 class="step-heading">The Diary of Lady Murasaki Shikibu</h2>
        <p class="step-poem">“Like two wild ducks</p>
        <p class="step-poem">Floating with unrestful slumber,</p>
        <p class="step-poem">Yet even those nights I would recall–</p>
        <p class="step-poem">  Feathers we and cold–</p>
        <p class="step-poem">But colder tears”</p>
        <br>
        <p class="step-content">Murasaki’s diary is a great example of how court diaries show all sorts of depictions of court life and 
          culture. It dually acts as an artifact of reflection of Murasaki’s personal struggles which have strong undertones on gender and 
          societal norms alongside the political power games of court life. Murasaki, as a lady-in-waiting in Heian court, gives us first-hand
           personal experiences of the ceremonial period of Heian life. Here we see poetry exchange, the importance and relevance of clothing,
            and religious rituals. The biggest event being the birth of the emperor's son, which highlighted a very politically significant 
            symbol that solidified the Fujiwara's family’s power (CITE). Throughout her diary we are introduced to two narrative voices that 
            Murasaki lives up to. On one hand she writes out of formality and duty in her position as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Soshi, 
            complimenting and praising the Empress (CITE). Through these court events she describes in high detail the dress and behaviour of 
            other women in court which presents the obsession and importance of aesthetics and etiquette. She goes as far to list out her 
            fellow ladies-in-waiting, commenting on their interactions and personalities and sometimes resorting to criticism (CITE). </p>
        <p class="step-content">On the other hand, she transforms her writings into moments of personal introspection which is less formal and 
          a more personal way of writing. She becomes very emotional and vulnerable as she reveals her struggles with dealing with people from 
          court and indicates her turn to devotion to Buddha. Her strong feelings of isolation come from her discomfort of the superficial 
          feelings from court society and her inability to connect with people who think as deeply as her, as she wants sincere companionship 
          and emotional intimacy. She reaches out to an old friend Lady Dianagon and expresses her missing emotional connection through 
          symbolism of ducks and wet feathers, expressing how memory and loss hurt more than her discomfort (CITE).
          The dual function that Murasaki gifts us with her work as both an official record and as a personal diary shows us how these diaries 
          were sociocultural tools which documented traditions and values but also through the emotional realities and internal struggles 
          of court society preserving these lived experiences.
          </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step" data-step="3">
        <h2 class="step-heading">The Diary of Izumi Shikibu</h2>
        <p class="step-poem">“Off the shore of aimlessness,</p>
        <p class="step-poem">With burning heart and dripping sleeves,</p>
        <p class="step-poem">I am he who drifts in the seaman’s boat”</p>
        <br>
        <p class="step-content">As a contemporary of Shikibu, Izumi was one of the court ladies criticized by Lady Murasaki, who stated 
          that "she conducts herself badly, and makes herself ridiculous by her silly behavior" (Omori & Doi, 1935, p. 134). This stems 
          from the scandalous love affair Lady Izumi writes about in her own diary about her relationships with two Princes, Prince 
          Atsumichi, the younger brother of her former lover, Prince Tametaka. Izumi Shikibu offers us a emotionally rich narrative on 
          her romantic relationships with a high blend of courting poetry that briefly exposes us to the political controversy in the 
          Heian court caused by such a relationship. She discloses her inner turmoil of being in a position of privilege and scrutiny 
          because of the affair. While her relationship gives her entry to royal inner circles, it’s still deemed as controversial and 
          inappropriate because of her previous relationship with the involved prince's deceased brother. The emotional core of the text 
          reveals the hardship of dealing with the courts obsession with status, reputation and romantic conduct. Izumi makes herself 
          emotionally vulnerable through the exchange of poems between her and the prince but also her self reflections and doubts, 
          questioning whether she should give into her desires or continue following the conduct of the court. Through each poem she 
          confronts the expectations placed upon her as a woman, a court figure, and a lover. </p>
        <p class="step-content">Her diary does a good job encapsulating the political and social structure of the Heian court and envelops
           the sociopolitical consequences that result from female desire and reputation. Although both Izumi and Prince Atsumichi were 
           advised against continuing their relationship, both people sought each other out, creating a rift between political figures 
           such as the prince and his marriage to a princess, her family, and their respective supporters. Much of Izumi’s reflections 
           are shaped by Buddhist beliefs and give a sense of aimlessness as her desires start diverging away from the expectations that 
           women have in relation to religion. While not as vibrant and eventful as Murasaki’s diary, Izumi encapsulates the strong 
           importance of poetry and its utilization for emotional exchange and a form of art within court life. It is presented as a tool
            for communication but also self expression with strong romantic affiliation and was a way that women could connect or 
            critique male-dominated structures. Through her events we see layers of love and loss in her writing through all stages of 
            her affair and can identify her shape of court culture through her writing.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step" data-step="4">
        <h2 class="step-heading">The Sarashina Diary</h2>
        <p class="step-poem">“The only thing that I could think of was the Shining Prince who would some day come to me, 
          as noble and beautiful as in the romance”</p>
        <br>
        <p class="step-content">Inspired at a young age, the daughter of Sugawara no Takasue developed an obsession with the romantic 
          tale; “The Tale of Genji”, written by none other than Murasaki Shikibu. However, unlike the courtly chronicles or love 
          confessions we’ve seen before, the Sarashina diary is a thoughtful memoir that records her life from girlhood to womanhood, reflecting 
          the broader understanding of Heian court life and gender expectations. She begins her diary expressing her interest in 
          the prince Genji, contemplating and living out a dream of finding her own prince in court life. This expectation however leads 
          her to believe in a false understanding of court life and romantic relationships, leading to disappointment and a lifetime of 
          yearning for the fantasy of the novel. Throughout her life, the author journals with strong emotional impressions when writing 
          about her dreams, regrets, and her moments of spiritual insight making it a quiet but powerful chronicle. </p>
        <p class="step-content">The diary is different in its lifespan but also as it remains in the margins/outliers of court life. The 
          author never fully assimilating into a court lifestyle, struggles to navigate her way through courtship, even failing after 
          having exchanged poems. She finds that after having experienced the court personally, the tale of Genji has eluded her to have 
          unrealistic expectations of court life and romance which she later reflects is an illusion. Although her hopes were debunked in 
          the earlier stages of her life, we find that she reconciles through different events of her life by thinking of the tale 
          because of her love for Genji and the promise it offered. As a result, she exposes the gap between the idealized femininity and 
          real lived experiences of women. Her writing is less focused on the political narrative of the court but reflects the 
          consequences of court expectations and how it affects women emotionally and psychologically because of the constraint of the 
          ideals. Her narrative always remains soft and melancholy as she reflects her true feelings alone with the moon, her happiness 
          when spending time with family, and her haphazard time spent alone in court when trying to find someone to court. In this way, 
          her diary is less about the visible structure of the court but the emotional aftermath which makes it a compelling record of 
          personal development in a world filled with ideals.</p>

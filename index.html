    <h1>Heian Court Diaries</h1>
    <p class="intro">Heian Court Diaries were written by aristocratic women and served as political records of women's lives in Heian Culture. These diaries heavily reflected and influenced gender roles, court traditions and rules, and literacy aesthetics. 
        As you scroll, you will see and experience images and narratives that  that illustrate how these writings shaped not only the personal identities of court women but also the broader sociopolitical landscape of Heian Japan.</p>
